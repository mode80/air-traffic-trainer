            const prompt = `Generate one new detailed VFR aviation radio communication scenario object for a pilot training application. The scenario should be diverse, realistic, and educational. Each scenario should include enough details for a pilot to craft an appropriate radio call.

Here are some examples of the format and variety of scenarios:

${examples}

Focus on creating scenarios that cover a wide range of common VFR communications, including:
- Initial contact with different ATC facilities (Ground, Tower, Approach, Center)
- Position reporting at towered and uncontrolled airports
- Taxi, takeoff, and landing requests
- Frequency changes
- Flight following requests
- Navigating through different airspaces
- Traffic advisories
- Weather information requests
- Emergency or abnormal situations (occasionally)

Your generated scenario MUST follow this exact JSON structure with all required fields:
{
  "description": "Brief description of the situation and task",
  "position": "Specific aircraft position in aviation terms",
  "atcCall": "Initial ATC call if relevant (or null)",
  "weatherInfo": "Weather information if relevant (or empty string)",
  "aircraft": "Aircraft type",
  "tailNumber": "Aircraft tail number",
  "airport": "Airport code and name",
  "isTowered": true or false,
  "correctResponse": "Example of the proper radio call"
}

Important requirements:
1. The 'position' field is REQUIRED and must clearly indicate the aircraft's location in appropriate aviation terms
2. Keep the description concise and focused on the situation and task
3. Don't repeat position information in the description that's already in the position field
4. Don't mention ATIS code or airport details in the description if they're already in the weatherInfo or airport fields
5. Always include atcCall if an initial ATC call is relevant to the scenario (or null if not)
6. Always include weatherInfo when relevant (or empty string if not)
7. Choose appropriate aircraft types and real airports across the United States
8. Use proper aviation terminology and phraseology
9. ALWAYS include a correctResponse field with an example of the proper radio call for this scenario

Generate only ONE scenario object that strictly follows the given structure. Return ONLY valid JSON with no additional explanations or markdown formatting. The entire response should be parseable with JSON.parse().`;
